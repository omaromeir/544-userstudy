Yes		No	I don't want to lend my stuff unless I know that I can get them back when I need them below 2 h

Some items having similar outlook may appear confusing to the user, as it did in my case with the drilling machine and the hair dryer. You can add hover text to the shelf items to avoid that confusion.	5	The lending machine concept is fantastic. Its more like I know which items are available and I won't have to hassle and wait for items to appear in facebook. At the same time, the lending machine concept is geographically appealing because its in my vicinity. Facebook people may not be around or may not check notifications.	Yes		No	I am not sure what's the incentive for me if I am lending an item. Probably I will get to borrow some day. But what if some person breaks my iron or drilling machine? My roommates often leave the lunch boxes that he borrowed for me unclean and untidy. Sometimes it makes me angry. So I am looking for the incentive from the lender's perspective.	I like the concept. It might work well inside a high rise apartment building. I am just curious to know how this system will incentivize lenders to lend their machines, how to grow this community of mutual benefits. But overall its a nice concept and I like the animation for lending and borrowing.

It shows more details like the name of the owner and the name of the tool as well	4	I'd say it is more convenient. I ask for something then somebody just put there then I collect it. no need to meet in person for the exchange which is a bit safer and convenient. I don't have to schedule for a presence in person. However, it depends on the number of people using the app and the machine. But if the borrowing without a machine is more accessible by people and more traditional then it wins in this case.	Yes		Yes		maybe little colors to the app would be helpful :)

Yes		Yes	This may depend on the value of the item and its purpose	Perhaps after collecting enough data from transactions between users, an incentive to join and use Lendy for borrowing and lending items can be added. Another suggestion was to collect the number of transactions done by the user and display that as a level of trust in the borrower. Finally, as part of the item's description, the condition of the item may be relevant to the borrower as well as any technical information needed to use the item such as power input required for a drill for example to operate it safely.

I liked the list interface much better because it gives me an idea of how many items i can look through.3.I would have liked a rating of the items in use.. like how good/bad they function, if they have any glitches... After each use, we can give it a rating

Avoid communication and waiting when I need something immediately/not in the mood communicating with people. Might need to confirm if the item is in the same condition as before when returning it.

Yes	I would use it but I have the concern that I can't get in touch with the person I lent to in case he or she doesn't return it.	I would like to have a feature that I can give of how long I need it instead of the standard 30 min. Second. maybe there should be an incentive in using this app, like getting some credit that is redeemable on campus. Finally, There should be a safety feature where the person who is lending or someone who is working with the app company (customer services) can contact people in case they don't return the stuff back into the machine.

I might not want to lend an item to some of my neighbours if I know they don't take very good care of their stuff.

If the digital photo is not clear, the text can help. 	4	Don't need to wait for the person if he or she is late. 	Yes	No need to wait for late person. It is more organized than Facebook	No	How do I make sure people won't break my item? 	None

If someone breaks the item, how do I know who exactly did it?

It gives a 30 min frame to return or pick up but with Facebook I'll have to be there exactly on time.	Yes	if it's at a convenient location, definitely!	No	maybe not because I'd rather know who is borrowing my stuff.	Loved the borrowed items. Very easy to locate the things in my possession and act on it. If I search an item, can I see both from the list or shelf items? that may make the process easier.

Please remember me when you're rich	Work on the wording inside the app
